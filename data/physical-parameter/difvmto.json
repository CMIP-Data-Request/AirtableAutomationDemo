    "description": "Diffusivity is also sometimes known as the coefficient of diffusion. Diffusion occurs as a result of a gradient in the spatial distribution of mass concentration, temperature or momentum.  The diffusivity may be very different in the vertical and horizontal directions. The construction vertical\\_X\\_diffusivity means the vertical component of the diffusivity of X due to motion which is not resolved on the grid scale of the model. \"Due to tides\" means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due\\_to\\_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.\n",

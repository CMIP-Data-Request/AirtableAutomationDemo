This would be most useful in GCMs that capture at least some of the\u00a0_aerosol effects on ice clouds,\u00a0_and might also prove useful to\u00a0understand how different degrees of ice-aerosol representations in models lead to differences in aerosol forcing_.\u00a0_This parameter could also be used in a similar fashion to\u00a0_clmodis_\u00a0as a test on how well models simulate ice cloud\u00a0_amount_\u00a0as well as ice cloud\u00a0_distribution_\u00a0(in CTP-COT or r\\_e-IWP space).\n",

Until now only cloud coverage is part of the physical variables in the CMOR tables. Additional insight into the models\u2019 performance in reproducing observed cloud properties is expected from using additional output from the COSP satellite simulator package, in particular ice and liquid water path resembling MODIS measurements.\n",

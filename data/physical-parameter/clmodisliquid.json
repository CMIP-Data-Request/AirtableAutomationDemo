    "justification-for-inclusion": "The MODIS instrument simulator is capable of producing cloud fraction joint histograms\u00a0akin to those from the ISCCP satellite simulator, but can further partition them by cloud-top phase. Furthermore, two versions of the joint histogram exist: one that aligns with the cloud-top pressure & cloud optical depth (CTP-COT) dimensions of the existing ISCCP histograms, and another partitioned by cloud droplet effective radius (r\\_e) and cloud liquid water path (LWP). This latter version can used in conjunction with cloud radiative kernels to estimate both the SW effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (SW ERFaci) from liquid clouds, and also the relative contributions of the Twomey effect, LWP adjustment, and cloud-fraction (CF) adjustment separately. This is a new technique that adopts a decomposition framework from the cloud feedback literature ([Zelinka 2012a](https://eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fclim%2F25%2F11%2Fjcli-d-11-00248.1.xml%3Ftab_body%3Dabstract-display&data=05%7C02%7CElisabeth.Dingley%40ext.esa.int%7Cd5a18aa3c0c94a4149ea08dcb5730745%7C9a5cacd02bef4dd7ac5c7ebe1f54f495%7C0%7C0%7C638584752864945047%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=0Ie0IdDPCr0pGBxlt0T16HO7vUfyzUbHnPzo1aqUQys%3D&reserved=0)\u00a0and\u00a0[Zelinka 2013](https://eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fclim%2F26%2F14%2Fjcli-d-12-00555.1.xml&data=05%7C02%7CElisabeth.Dingley%40ext.esa.int%7Cd5a18aa3c0c94a4149ea08dcb5730745%7C9a5cacd02bef4dd7ac5c7ebe1f54f495%7C0%7C0%7C638584752864952800%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mlEna4KNYajh34b%2FFpZK4AMBlwGH%2BBb5wlGLbWcfHSs%3D&reserved=0)).

    "description": "'Mole concentration' means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction mole\\_concentration\\_of\\_X\\_in\\_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox\\_expressed\\_as\\_nitrogen'. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due\\_to\\_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  \"tendency\\_of\\_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.\n",

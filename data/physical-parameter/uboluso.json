    "justification-for-inclusion": "This variable is essential to be able to accurately assess ocean circulation and transports.  The bolus (parameterized) velocity is particularly important in regions where there is a lot of eddy activity, like gyre boundaries and in the Southern Ocean.  In the Southern Ocean without the bolus velocities the transports are often incorrect/in the wrong direction.\n",

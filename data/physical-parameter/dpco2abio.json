    "description": "Difference in partial pressure of abiotic-analogue carbon dioxide between sea water and air.  The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. An abiotic analogue is used to simulate the effect on a modelled variable when biological effects on ocean carbon concentration and alkalinity are ignored.\n",

    "description": "'Mole concentration' means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction mole\\_concentration\\_of\\_X\\_in\\_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox\\_expressed\\_as\\_nitrogen'. The concentration of any chemical species, whether particulate or dissolved, may vary with depth in the ocean.  A depth profile may go through one or more local minima in concentration. The mole\\_concentration\\_of\\_molecular\\_oxygen\\_in\\_sea\\_water\\_at\\_shallowest\\_local\\_minimum\\_in\\_vertical\\_profile is the mole concentration of oxygen at the local minimum in the concentration profile that occurs closest to the sea surface.\n",

This is particularly true if ocean transects are being investigated. Furthermore, attempting to estimate these parameters using the longitudes and latitudes from the t,u and v grid points often leads to incorrect values due to some models artificially narrowing channels (e.g. Strait of Gibraltar and between various islands in the Indonesian Through flow region.\n",

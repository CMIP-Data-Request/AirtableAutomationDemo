    "justification-for-inclusion": "It was effectively assumed that the surface has an emissivity of 1.0 so people could use the all-sky upwelling flux. This is not the case for modern climate models which use emissivities < 1.0 which results in local differences of several W/m^2. This affects the ability to compute clear-sky surface budgets and cloud radiative effect.\n",

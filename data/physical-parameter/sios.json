    "description": "Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole\\_concentration\\_of\\_X\\_in\\_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox\\_expressed\\_as\\_nitrogen\". \"Dissolved inorganic silicon\" means the sum of all inorganic silicon in solution (including silicic acid and its first dissociated anion SiO(OH)3-).\n",

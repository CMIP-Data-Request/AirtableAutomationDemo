    "description": "The phrase \"tendency\\_of\\_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Specific\" means per unit mass. Specific humidity is the mass fraction of water vapor in (moist) air. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due\\_to\\_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. A variable with the standard name of tendency\\_of\\_specific\\_humidity\\_due\\_to\\_stratiform\\_cloud\\_and\\_precipitation should contain the effects of all processes which convert stratiform clouds and precipitation to or from water vapor. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes).\n",

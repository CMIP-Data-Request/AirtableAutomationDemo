Report 12 monthly values, starting with January, even if the values do not vary seasonally.  When calling CMOR, identify this variable as co2Clim, not co2.   If  CO2 is spatially uniform, omit this field, but report Total Atmospheric Mass of CO2 (see the table entry after the next).  Are these the preferred units or should it be a unitless fraction?  Should this field be reported instead on model levels?  Or should we also require either the vertically integrated mole fraction (or mass?) of this species or the vertically integrated globally averaged mole fraction (or mass?)?\n",

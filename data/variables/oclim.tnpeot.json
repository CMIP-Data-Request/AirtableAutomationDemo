    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  Potential energy is the sum of the gravitational potential energy relative to the geoid and the centripetal potential energy. (The geopotential is the specific potential energy.)  \"Due to tides\" means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides.  No distinction is made between different tidal components. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due\\_to\\_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  \"tendency\\_of\\_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.\n",

Report 12 monthly values, starting with January, even if the values do not vary seasonally.  When calling CMOR, identify this variable as ch4globalClim, not ch4global.  If CH4 is spatially nonuniform, omit this field, but report Global Mean Mole Fraction of CH4 (see the table entry before the previous one).   Are these the preferred units or should it be a unitless fraction?  Should this field be reported instead on model levels?  Or should we also require either the vertically integrated mole fraction (or mass?) of this species or the vertically integrated globally averaged mole fraction (or mass?)?\n",

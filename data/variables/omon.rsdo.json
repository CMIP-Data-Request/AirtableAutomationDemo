    "description": "Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean \"net downward\".  When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called \"irradiance\".  In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called \"vector irradiance\".  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.  \"shortwave\" means shortwave radiation.\n",

Include enough depth levels to represent  the non-zero values of this field everywhere on the globe. Report on native horizontal grid. If a function of depth, perform online remapping to depth or pressure, if not native vertical grid.\n",

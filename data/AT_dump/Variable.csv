The TAS diagnostic will be a weighted mean of the air temperatures over land and sea. If the diagnostic (lets call it LTAS) is available, we can then diagnose the air temperatures just over land, and in conjunction with TAS and SFTLF diagnose the air temperatures just over sea/sea-ice in coastal gridboxes. This will enable consistent comparisons with observational datasets (e.g. CRUTEM5 which is just air temperature over land) over regional areas with large coastal areas.

The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium.

The phrase ""residual mean advection"" refers to the sum of the model's resolved advective transport plus any parameterized advective transport. Parameterized advective transport includes processes such as parameterized mesoscale and submesoscale transport, as well as any other advectively parameterized transport. When the parameterized advective transport is represented in the model as a skew-diffusion rather than an advection, then the parameterized skew diffusion should be included in this diagnostic, since the convergence of skew-fluxes are identical (in the continuous formulation) to the convergence of advective fluxes.

It is the depth at which density is larger than the density of the first model level+ a threshold of 0.03 kg.m-3 (appendix H24). We propose to make the reference depth 10 m instead of the first model level (note than some modelling groups already did it that way for CMIP6). A recent study based on OMIP (Treguier et al. 2023, <https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5194\/gmd-16-3849-2023> )discusses the fact that using the first model level as a reference makes mlotst less comparable with obs (obs-based datasets reference the MLD to 10m because the diurnal cycle is not well-sampled by observations). Furthermore, the difference of the depth of the first model level between different models makes a significant difference in the computed MLDs in some seasons\/regions (Treguier et al., 2023).\n",

Comparing models between each other or with observations becomes useless, because based on the method sfcWind is obtained, there can be up to 25% difference. \n\nAdditionally, it is unclear how sfcWindmax is obtained, is it instantaneous? Is it for the model time step? Since CMIP6 docs are down, I had to track the modelling centers to ask this questions and everyone has a different opinions even within one center. Again this makes multi-model ensembles very uncertain and both daily and sub-daily sfcWind and sfcWindmax are incredibly important for adaptation.\n",

Ofx.basin is the only CMIP6 variable that uses these CF terms. As the structure record is not being used to define variables in CMIP7, we need to move the information somewhere else. This potentially means adding one or two columns in one of the Air TAble tables. \n\n1. Add \"Flag Values\" and \"Flag Meanings\" columns in the \"Physical Parameter\" table. These columns would be blank for all other variables, but it is easy to implement.  \n2. It may be clearer to use the \"Units\" table, and rename it \"Units and Flags\". The examples given for flag\\_values and flag\\_meanings in the CF Conventions document to not include a \"units\" value because there is no unit of measure here: each value in the Ofx.basin field is just a flag to be associated with a character value. This means that the value of \"units\" is redundant for this variable. Placing the flag\\_values and the flag\\_meanings in the \"Units and Flags\" table will make it easier to attach a clear explanation of this feature. This will not impact on how the information is exported to MIP Tables.

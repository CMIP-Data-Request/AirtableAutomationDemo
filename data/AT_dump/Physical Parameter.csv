Parameterized advective transport includes processes such as parameterized mesoscale and submesoscale transport, as well as any other advectively parameterized transport. When the parameterized advective transport is represented in the model as a skew-diffusion rather than an advection, then the parameterized skew diffusion should be included in this diagnostic, since the convergence of skew-fluxes are identical (in the continuous formulation) to the convergence of advective fluxes.

This latter version can used in conjunction with cloud radiative kernels to estimate both the SW effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (SW ERFaci) from liquid clouds, and also the relative contributions of the Twomey effect, LWP adjustment, and cloud-fraction (CF) adjustment separately. This is a new technique that adopts a decomposition framework from the cloud feedback literature ([Zelinka 2012a](https://eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fclim%2F25%2F11%2Fjcli-d-11-00248.1.xml%3Ftab_body%3Dabstract-display&data=05%7C02%7CElisabeth.Dingley%40ext.esa.int%7Cd5a18aa3c0c94a4149ea08dcb5730745%7C9a5cacd02bef4dd7ac5c7ebe1f54f495%7C0%7C0%7C638584752864945047%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=0Ie0IdDPCr0pGBxlt0T16HO7vUfyzUbHnPzo1aqUQys%3D&reserved=0) and [Zelinka 2013](https://eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fclim%2F26%2F14%2Fjcli-d-12-00555.1.xml&data=05%7C02%7CElisabeth.Dingley%40ext.esa.int%7Cd5a18aa3c0c94a4149ea08dcb5730745%7C9a5cacd02bef4dd7ac5c7ebe1f54f495%7C0%7C0%7C638584752864952800%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mlEna4KNYajh34b%2FFpZK4AMBlwGH%2BBb5wlGLbWcfHSs%3D&reserved=0)).

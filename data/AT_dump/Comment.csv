rec3SVb9mtR49l4pC,Reference level should be 10m for ocean mixed layer depth mlotst,"The method to calculate the mixed layer depth (mlotst) is documented in Griffies et al. 2016 ( <https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3231-2016> ). It is the depth at which density is larger than the density of the first model level+ a threshold of 0.03 kg.m-3 (appendix H24). We propose to make the reference depth 10 m instead of the first model level (note than some modelling groups already did it that way for CMIP6). A recent study based on OMIP (Treguier et al. 2023, <https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3849-2023> )discusses the fact that using the first model level as a reference makes mlotst less comparable with obs (obs-based datasets reference the MLD to 10m because the diurnal cycle is not well-sampled by observations). Furthermore, the difference of the depth of the first model level between different models makes a significant difference in the computed MLDs in some seasons/regions (Treguier et al., 2023).

Comparing models between each other or with observations becomes useless, because based on the method sfcWind is obtained, there can be up to 25% difference. 

Additionally, it is unclear how sfcWindmax is obtained, is it instantaneous? Is it for the model time step? Since CMIP6 docs are down, I had to track the modelling centers to ask this questions and everyone has a different opinions even within one center. Again this makes multi-model ensembles very uncertain and both daily and sub-daily sfcWind and sfcWindmax are incredibly important for adaptation.

We may therefore have to update the cell measures accordingly.
Furthermore, since ocean and sea ice will have different cell areas, it must be established whether this metric can be covered in one variable (using both cell measures areacella and areacello where appropriate) or whether this should be rather split into two variables - one for ocean, one for land / land ice.

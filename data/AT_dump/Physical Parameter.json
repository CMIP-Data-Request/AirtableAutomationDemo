In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes).\n",

The phrase \"residual mean advection\" refers to the sum of the model's resolved advective transport plus any parameterized advective transport. Parameterized advective transport includes processes such as parameterized mesoscale and submesoscale transport, as well as any other advectively parameterized transport. When the parameterized advective transport is represented in the model as a skew-diffusion rather than an advection, then the parameterized skew diffusion should be included in this diagnostic, since the convergence of skew-fluxes are identical (in the continuous formulation) to the convergence of advective fluxes.\n",

It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.   'Sinking' is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid. Calcite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of calcite is CaCO3. Standard names also exist for aragonite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate.\n",

The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium.

        "Justification for inclusion":"The MODIS instrument simulator is capable of producing cloud fraction joint histograms\u00a0akin to those from the ISCCP satellite simulator, but can further partition them by cloud-top phase. Furthermore, two versions of the joint histogram exist: one that aligns with the cloud-top pressure & cloud optical depth (CTP-COT) dimensions of the existing ISCCP histograms, and another partitioned by cloud droplet effective radius (r\\_e) and cloud liquid water path (LWP). This latter version can used in conjunction with cloud radiative kernels to estimate both the SW effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (SW ERFaci) from liquid clouds, and also the relative contributions of the Twomey effect, LWP adjustment, and cloud-fraction (CF) adjustment separately. This is a new technique that adopts a decomposition framework from the cloud feedback literature ([Zelinka 2012a](https:\/\/eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fclim%2F25%2F11%2Fjcli-d-11-00248.1.xml%3Ftab_body%3Dabstract-display&data=05%7C02%7CElisabeth.Dingley%40ext.esa.int%7Cd5a18aa3c0c94a4149ea08dcb5730745%7C9a5cacd02bef4dd7ac5c7ebe1f54f495%7C0%7C0%7C638584752864945047%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=0Ie0IdDPCr0pGBxlt0T16HO7vUfyzUbHnPzo1aqUQys%3D&reserved=0)\u00a0and\u00a0[Zelinka 2013](https:\/\/eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fclim%2F26%2F14%2Fjcli-d-12-00555.1.xml&data=05%7C02%7CElisabeth.Dingley%40ext.esa.int%7Cd5a18aa3c0c94a4149ea08dcb5730745%7C9a5cacd02bef4dd7ac5c7ebe1f54f495%7C0%7C0%7C638584752864952800%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mlEna4KNYajh34b%2FFpZK4AMBlwGH%2BBb5wlGLbWcfHSs%3D&reserved=0)).

This parameter alone is an important metric for comparing the simulation of clouds across models, given the differences\u00a0between the MODIS and ISCCP instrument simulators (summarized in\u00a0[Pincus et al 2012](https:\/\/eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fclim%2F25%2F13%2Fjcli-d-11-00267.1.xml&data=05%7C02%7CElisabeth.Dingley%40ext.esa.int%7Cd5a18aa3c0c94a4149ea08dcb5730745%7C9a5cacd02bef4dd7ac5c7ebe1f54f495%7C0%7C0%7C638584752864920723%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ATWFk2FgzgikZKn86KzeC6sZWzk1P7qICZos2SW4bbU%3D&reserved=0)). Furthermore, it is an important supplement to\u00a0_clmodisice\u00a0_and\u00a0_clmodisliquid_, as it can be used to decompose forcing from liquid- and ice-clouds into their \"true\" components by accounting for obscuration effects (ie, removing the component of aerosol forcing from liquid clouds that comes from changes in overlying ice clouds, rather than changes from the liquid clouds themselves). Furthermore, this metric can be used as output in historical simulations to compare MODIS simulator output from a GCM to MODIS observations to evaluate model performance (as in\u00a0[Klein 2013,](https:\/\/eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fagupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1002%2Fjgrd.50141&data=05%7C02%7CElisabeth.Dingley%40ext.esa.int%7Cd5a18aa3c0c94a4149ea08dcb5730745%7C9a5cacd02bef4dd7ac5c7ebe1f54f495%7C0%7C0%7C638584752864934620%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=lYOP6ftNOiR%2B64ObT5%2BGRCyd26gOnT%2BxegT2HM3lKT8%3D&reserved=0)\u00a0but using the MODIS simulator).\n",

Stratiform precipitation, whether liquid or frozen, is precipitation that formed in stratiform cloud. Graupel consists of heavily rimed snow particles, often called snow pellets; often indistinguishable from very small soft hail except when the size convention that hail must have a diameter greater than 5 mm is adopted. Reference: American Meteorological Society Glossary <http:\/\/glossary.ametsoc.org\/wiki\/Graupel>. There are also separate standard names for hail. Standard names for \"graupel\\_and\\_hail\" should be used to describe data produced by models that do not distinguish between hail and graupel.\n",

In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.   'Sinking' is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid. Aragonite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of aragonite is CaCO3. Standard names also exist for calcite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate.\n",

The passive tracer is transported within the ocean as if it were potential temperature. The passive tracer is zero in the control climate of the model. The passive tracer records added heat, as described for the CMIP6 FAFMIP experiment (doi:10.5194\/gmd-9-3993-2016), following earlier ideas. Potential temperature is the temperature a parcel of air or sea water would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure.\n",

For example, any vertical diffusion which is part of the boundary layer mixing scheme should be included, while numerical diffusion applied in addition to physics or resolved dynamics should be excluded.

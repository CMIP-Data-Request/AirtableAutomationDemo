        "Description":"Diffusivity is also sometimes known as the coefficient of diffusion. Diffusion occurs as a result of a gradient in the spatial distribution of mass concentration, temperature or momentum.  The diffusivity may be very different in the vertical and horizontal directions. \"xy diffusivity\" means the lateral along\\_coordinate component of diffusivity due to motion which is not resolved on the grid scale of the model.  xy diffusivities are used in some ocean models to counteract the numerical instabilities inherent in certain implementations of rotated neutral diffusion. \"biharmonic diffusivity\" means diffusivity for use with a biharmonic diffusion operator.\n",

The TAS diagnostic will be a weighted mean of the air temperatures over land and sea. If the diagnostic (lets call it LTAS) is available, we can then diagnose the air temperatures just over land, and in conjunction with TAS and SFTLF diagnose the air temperatures just over sea\/sea-ice in coastal gridboxes. This will enable consistent comparisons with observational datasets (e.g. CRUTEM5 which is just air temperature over land) over regional areas with large coastal areas. \nReference: Jones, GS, 2020,  \"Apples and oranges\": on comparing near surface temperatures from climate models with observations, QJRMS, 146, Issue 733, 3747-3771, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/qj.3871.\n",

The passive tracer is initialised to the potential temperature in the control climate before the perturbation is imposed. Its surface flux is the heat flux from the atmosphere, not including the imposed perturbation, and is converted to a passive tracer increment as if it were being added to potential temperature. The passive tracer is transported within the ocean as if it were potential temperature. \n",

In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.   'Sinking' is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid. Calcite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of calcite is CaCO3. Standard names also exist for aragonite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate.\n",

        "Title":"Surface Downwelling Longwave Radiation",
        "Description":"The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"longwave\" means longwave radiation. Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean \"net downward\". When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called \"irradiance\". In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called \"vector irradiance\". In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.\n",

Net primary production is the excess of gross primary production (rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs (\"producers\"), for example, photosynthesis in plants or phytoplankton, over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. \"Productivity\" means production per unit area. The phrase \"expressed\\_as\" is used in the construction A\\_expressed\\_as\\_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A.

In ocean biogeochemistry models, a \"natural analogue\" is used to simulate the effect on a modelled variable of imposing preindustrial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, even when the model as a whole may be subjected to varying forcings. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure which it alone would exert with unchanged temperature and number of moles per unit volume. The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure difference between sea water and air is positive when the partial pressure of the dissolved gas in sea water is greater than the partial pressure in air.\n",

In ocean biogeochemistry models, an \"abiotic analogue\" is used to simulate the effect on a modelled variable when biological effects on ocean carbon concentration and alkalinity are ignored. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure which it alone would exert with unchanged temperature and number of moles per unit volume. The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure difference between sea water and air is positive when the partial pressure of the dissolved gas in sea water is greater than the partial pressure in air.\n",

The surface flux is expressed as a heat flux and converted to a passive tracer increment as if it were a heat flux being added to potential temperature. The passive tracer is transported within the ocean as if it were potential temperature. The passive tracer is zero in the control climate of the model. The passive tracer records added heat, as described for the CMIP6 FAFMIP experiment (doi:10.5194\/gmd-9-3993-2016), following earlier ideas. Potential temperature is the temperature a parcel of air or sea water would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure.\n",

'Sinking' is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid.

The phrase \"residual mean advection\" refers to the sum of the model's resolved advective transport plus any parameterized advective transport. Parameterized advective transport includes processes such as parameterized mesoscale and submesoscale transport, as well as any other advectively parameterized transport. When the parameterized advective transport is represented in the model as a skew-diffusion rather than an advection, then the parameterized skew diffusion should be included in this diagnostic, since the convergence of skew-fluxes are identical (in the continuous formulation) to the convergence of advective fluxes.\n",
